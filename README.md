Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python using MinMax Algorithm. I have tried to comment the code as much as possible and is kept as simple as possible. The code makes use of MinMax Algorithm which is essentially a Recursive Algorithm. You can read more about the algorithm [Here](https://www.neverstopbuilding.com/blog/minimax). Kudos to the author of the above site for explaining it very clearly.
